## Guacamole

Guacamole provides access to desktop environments using remote desktop
protocols like VNC and RDP. A centralized server acts as a tunnel and proxy,
allowing access to multiple desktops through a web browser.
No browser plugins are needed, and no client software needs to be installed.
The client requires nothing more than a web browser supporting HTML5 and AJAX.
